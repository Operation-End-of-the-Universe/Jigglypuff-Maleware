# Jigglypuff-Maleware (W.I.P.)
Jigglypuff Maleware, a maleware made with a image of Jigglypuff, don't ask why. Starfall & Zophia asked

oh yeah apprently ch'en helped make the OEOU wiki if you want a better explanation lol: https://oeou.fandom.com/wiki

WARNING: The J.P.M. does not go up against the International Law or Github's TOS. If this is suddenly deleted, oh well. 

Side note: The J.P.M. is only meant for testing purposes to test OEOU's Maleware Accelerator where it is a product that will be sold. It accelerates and runs the virus/maleware so fast that it malfunctions and doesn't work anymore. We've had a 75:198 sucess rate which is like around 50%. It's still a WIP

To Ch'en and Starfall, MAKE THIS THE MOST STUPIDEST THING EVER FOOLS HAHA -zophia 

ye fuck you z, no one likes you - starfall
